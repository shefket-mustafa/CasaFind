# 🏡 CasaFind

**CasaFind** is a modern, responsive real estate web application built with **React + TypeScript**, powered by **Context API** for global state management. It features a dynamic catalog of property listings, user-controlled submissions, and smooth UI animations powered by **Framer Motion** and **Tailwind CSS**. The app is designed as a practice project to solidify frontend architecture, form validation with **Yup**, and React ecosystem fundamentals.

> 🚧 This is a learning-focused project, and a work in progress. The goal is to master component organization, form control, client-side validation, and dynamic rendering of real estate data.
